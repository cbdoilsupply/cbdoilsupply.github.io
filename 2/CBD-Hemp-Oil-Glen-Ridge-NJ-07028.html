Unlike cannabis, hemp doesn't have THC and won't have psychoactive effects. Hemp oil has been on the market for quite some time; it is not a newly developed product. CBD is not the same thing as THC, although both are cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant.

Phrases such as Hemp-derived, Full spectrum, Pure cannabidiol, and Certified CBD must be mentioned in the label. CBD oil comes from the buds, flowers, and leaves of the plant.

<p>This suggests there could be a human application for pain and inflammation treatment There are some possibilities suggested here,” says Dr. Ring.
