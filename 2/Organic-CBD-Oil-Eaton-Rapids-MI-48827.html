Being responsible for marijuana's pain-relieving effects, cannabidiol doesn't have its side effects. With the rapid rise in the popularity of CBD in everything from vape juice to lattes, many people are asking, What is CBD oil?”.</p>
<p>Hemp is a prime source of CBD and other influential cannabinoids, and it's also a highly sustainable crop involved in dozens of industries. When medical marijuana is prescribed, it is used to help people with conditions such as MS. You receive a clean, natural hemp product with an abundance of CBDa.

High potency CBD oils are ideal for those seeking a powerful, therapeutic effect.

<p>Technically speaking, the law now recognizes hemp (and by association CBD oil) as a non-controlled substance and differentiates it from marijuana. One of the most crucial steps in producing CBD oil is isolating the relevant cannabinoids and terpenes via CO₂ extraction. This being the case, there are a lot of companies taking advantage of the CBD oil demand thus are making products that don't contain enough or any CBD at all. Meanwhile, hemp seed oil (sometimes called just hemp oil) is made from only the seeds of the hemp plant and contains minuscule (if any) quantities of CBD.</p>
