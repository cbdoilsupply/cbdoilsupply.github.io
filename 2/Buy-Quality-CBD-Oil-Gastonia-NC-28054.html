<p>We've found that the best way to evaluate CBD oils is to work out the cost per mg of CBD in the product. Many studies - both animal and human - have examined the link between CBD and pain relief, which are thought to be down to the oil's ability to reduce inflammation and interact with neurotransmitters.
