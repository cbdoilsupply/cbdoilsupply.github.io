<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. When the Control Substance Act was passed in 1970, cultivation of both hemp and marijuana was banned, making it even hard to research or use CBD extract. Luckily, if the level of CBD is high enough, the psychoactive side effects of THC are counteracted. However, scientists believe CBD encourages the body to produce more endocannabinoids. The hemp the brand uses was specifically bred to have high CBD and really low THC. All of our CBD products are guaranteed to contain 0% THC, and each and every product that leaves the facility is third-party tested to ensure consistency and quality.</p>
<p>Also, don't forget to check our online shop as we are constantly working to update it with new products. Marijuana derived CBD products are illegal on the federal level but legal under the laws of some states. With most countries outlawing cannabis and cannabinoid ingredients entirely, some allowing medical use for cannabis and some allowing CBD but not THC, it can be very difficult for effective CBD studies to be carried out on any kind of large scale.
