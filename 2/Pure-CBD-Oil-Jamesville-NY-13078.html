<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. More research is needed to determine the exact role that terpenes play in the overall effects of CBD oil, but it seems clear that terpenes work in concert with cannabinoids to produce a richer effect than CBD alone. First, testing by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has found evidence of ‘potential adverse health effects' from CBD (more on that later) and the FSA has concerns over CBD products being sold that contain unlisted and possibly even hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of psychoactive THC.</p>
<p>To keep CBD products off its site, Amazon says it deploys advanced algorithms designed to sniff out descriptions that could hint at the banned ingredient. CBD and THC are potent neuroprotective antioxidants ; much like other nutritional supplements, they can help reverse the aging process and keep our cells healthy and vibrant. Usually, you'll find hemp, hemp extract, or hemp oil listed as the main ingredients on a bottle of CBD oil or tincture.

Since cannabidiol has been studied as a new drug, it can't be legally included in foods or dietary supplements Also, cannabidiol can't be included in products marketed with therapeutic claims.

As you begin to explore the interesting world of CBD, you may be shocked to discover that there is a large variety of types, companies , and potencies of products available and it can be quite overwhelming to someone looking into buying CBD oil.

For therapeutic uses, many people prefer hemp-derived CBD products, as they do not cause intoxication.</p>
