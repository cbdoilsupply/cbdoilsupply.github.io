<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. Scientists have identified over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids. There are literally hundreds of CBD companies selling CBD online that will ship directly to your door — many of which don't even charge for shipping.</p>
