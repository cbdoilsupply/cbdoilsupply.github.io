<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>
<p>Kevin Boehnke, PhD, a researcher at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center at the University of Michigan, focuses on medical cannabis as an analgesic and opioid substitute in chronic pain. We've included a list of some of our favorite CBD oils above. A full-spectrum CBD oil, on the other hand, refers to CBD extracted from the hemp plant. So, if your dog is suffering from anxiety, CBD from hemp oil would be a great way to keep him relaxed when he's uncomfortable. Also, our gummies are our only products that use a CBD with zero THC (our other products are made from full-spectrum hemp extract).</p>

With that, it's safe to say that it's one of the best ones when it comes to creating high-quality CBD oil.</p>
<p>There's more — anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune conditions — CBD is worth a look in any disease process that's rooted in inflammation (which is most of them). So for CBD products from hemp, check labels to see whether they say where it was grown, and look especially for those from Colorado. All the products listed above are made from full-spectrum CBD that contains less than 0.3 percent THC. Some people freeze when they hear the word cannabis.” That's because many people use cannabis” and marijuana” synonymously to describe the drug that gets you high.</p>

Cannabidiol is derived from the cannabis plant, and comes with a wealth of health benefits. A few of the main ways people are using CBD these days is through edibles like gummies, CBD oil, and vaping.</p>
<p>CBD oil concentrate is all-natural hemp oil extracted from the stalk of non-GMO hemp plants, tested for quality, and packaged for sale in an easy-to-use oral applicator with no additives. CBD percentages: Watch out for products advertising whole plant extract percentages of CBD, as opposed to the level of CBD in mgs in the product. However, many companies only offer CBD oil in low to moderate potencies. While previously hemp was only legal to grow for hemp pilot programs and research needs, the passage of the 2018 bill reclassified hemp as an agricultural commodity and made it legal to produce all hemp-derived products, including CBD oil.</p>
