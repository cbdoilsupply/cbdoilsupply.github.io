Much of the research on cannabis products has looked at the use of marijuana rather than at CBD oil as a standalone product. Broad spectrum CBD oil contains a variety of active compounds such as cannabinoids and terpenes, which we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 2.

According to the researchstudy, GPR55 has actually also been found in a variety of fatal healthconditions.
