When the Control Substance Act was passed in 1970, cultivation of both hemp and marijuana was banned, making it even hard to research or use CBD extract. Luckily, if the level of CBD is high enough, the psychoactive side effects of THC are counteracted. However, scientists believe CBD encourages the body to produce more endocannabinoids. The hemp the brand uses was specifically bred to have high CBD and really low THC.
