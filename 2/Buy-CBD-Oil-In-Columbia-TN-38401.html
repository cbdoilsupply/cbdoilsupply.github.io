<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not.

<p>By augmenting the body's own cannabinoids, CBD and the other trace cannabinoids found in hemp oil are able to stimulate the endocannabinoid system to encourage balance and optimal functioning. However, when used in moderate amounts, most people do not experience these side effects, and none of them are known for being fatal or particularly dangerous. Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>

<p>Many of them do not have access to proper healthcare, and medication is expensive, so CBD is a helpful alternative to pharmaceutical drugs (CBD does not cure anything, though, and is not a replacement for pharmaceutical medications — it only makes symptoms more comfortable to live with). And the morning formula includes hemp oil, CBD, CBDa, and adaptogenic herbs.

<p>In other words, they tend to have a better day when they are on treatment with CBD-rich cannabis. CBD oil derived from hemp will not produce a high.” Hemp is a type of cannabis plant grown for industrial use, such as making paper and clothing. For example, if the product contains 500 mg of CBD, the same concentration of cannabinoids should be mentioned in the report. So CBD oils extracted with solvents will contain a lower concentration of CBD. In AD 77, Pliny the Elder claims that the Romans used cannabis hemp to relief pain and to perform healing arts.</p>
<p>A research backed alternative to address pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, along with fungal and bacterial infection” (Russo, 2011). There are now an estimated quarter of a million regular users in the UK, turning to CBD to support general wellness, ease anxiety, sleep problems and chronic pain among other things.
