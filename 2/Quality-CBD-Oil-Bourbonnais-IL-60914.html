<p>It's important to look at the entire product when purchasing CBD oil. Because of the legally murky nature of marijuana, the FDA has not stepped in to regulate products like CBD oil, Bonn-Miller said. In fact, the benefits of CBD oil have no connection to a typical marijuana high. These effects typically wear off within hours, although people who take prescription medication should check with their doctor to ensure the oil won't counteract the effects of other drugs.
