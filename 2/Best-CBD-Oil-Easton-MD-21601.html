<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. They claim that they make no distinction between CBD derived from marijuana and CBD derived from hemp, and since the state has set up no regulations under the 2018 Agricultural Act regarding hemp, even CBD derived from hemp is illegal unless it's purchased from a licensed medical cannabis dispensary. Scientists have identified over 113 different cannabinoids in cannabis sativa, and each interacts with the endocannabinoid system in a slightly different way, offering potential therapeutic benefits. CBD hemp oil comes in seemingly endless forms, each with a different concentration of CBD and other phytocannabinoids.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about CBD oils, this guide will provide unbiased information on the background, benefits, risks, side effects, and legality of this product. If you've done any researching at all about hemp CBD oil in the United States, you've probably heard about Charlotte's Web.

Hemp Bombs is another company that oversees the whole process of their CBD products, from seed to sale. There are still no regulations for how often CBD products must be tested. CBD oil is made by extracting CBD from the cannabis or hemp plants and then mixing it with a carrier such as MCT oil. Because it has a high cannabidiol (CBD) content, most CBD products are derived from this plant.</p>
<p>This means that a doctor must apply to the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) for an approval to be able to prescribe products containing CBD. The CBD in most products is extracted from hemp, a variety of cannabis that has only traces (up to 0.3%) of THC, the active compound that gets people high. Many CBD products display the percentage of CBD contained in the product, which will be between around 2% and 11% of the total (the rest being made up of hemp oil and other ingredients such as olive oil). Alongside this, CBD - in combination with THC - has received regulatory approvals in several European countries and is under study in registered trials with the FDA.</p>
