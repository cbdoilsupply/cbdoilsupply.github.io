<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. Scientists have identified over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids. There are literally hundreds of CBD companies selling CBD online that will ship directly to your door — many of which don't even charge for shipping.</p>
<p>By augmenting the body's own cannabinoids, CBD and the other trace cannabinoids found in hemp oil are able to stimulate the endocannabinoid system to encourage balance and optimal functioning. However, when used in moderate amounts, most people do not experience these side effects, and none of them are known for being fatal or particularly dangerous. Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>
