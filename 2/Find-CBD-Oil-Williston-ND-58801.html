<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN). In a 2016 study , Scott Shannon and his fellow researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins demonstrated that CBD oil can be safely and effectively used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders in children with PTSD.</p>

In one study on morphine-addicted rats, CBD oil allowed them to reduce their dependence on the drug. CBD oil isn't likely to cause the same set of negative effects. Another study carried out a couple of years later confirmed that CBD has the potential of relieving inflammation and pain linked to arthritis when applied topically.</p>
