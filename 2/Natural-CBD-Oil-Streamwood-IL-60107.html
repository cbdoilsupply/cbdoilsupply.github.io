Both hemp and marijuana come from the same plant (Cannabis sativa), which creates a fair amount of confusion. Not all products, however, include that information. While CBD is often used to increase appetites, decrease nausea and decrease pain experienced by cancer patients, the true benefits of the compound may be further reaching.

Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>
