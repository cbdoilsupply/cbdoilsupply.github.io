<p>However, there's no guarantee these products will be of good quality. When combined with THC, CBD may actually minimize the psychotropic effects of THC by inhibiting the THC from binding to cannabis receptors. Before we talk about the benefits of CBD massage oil, let's first explain what a CBD massage is. CBD stands for Cannabidiol which is the cannabinoid in cannabis.
