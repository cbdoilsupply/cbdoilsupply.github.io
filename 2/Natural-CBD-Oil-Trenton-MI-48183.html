<p>However, as an individual interested in CBD use, here's what you need to know: CBD products derived from hemp, and containing less than 0.3% THC, are legal in most states. CBD oils also contain other nutritious material from the hemp plant, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, terpenes, vitamins, minerals, chlorophyll, amino acids and other trace cannabinoids.
