<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. CBD has been shown, through small studies, to aid in reducing social anxiety disorder. Since July, all hemp-derived CBD products sold in stores in Indiana must include a QR code on their label that lets consumers download a product's COA to their phone. These effects make cannabidiol able to diminish the burning, prickling and tingling sensations often associated with neuropathic or nerve related pain as well as pain related to inflammation. In CBD sublingual oil, the hemp oil is combined with MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oil that's derived from coconuts.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that people have been using cannabis medicinally since at least 2900 B.C. However, we are just now beginning to understand cannabis' effects on the body - and even today, there are still large gaps in our knowledge of this fascinating plant. The capability of CBD oil to reduce inflammation is beneficial for the management of many different conditions.

CBD oil multipacks are available with hemp and olive oil carriers and come in concentrations from 5-20% CBD. CBD oil brand Celtic Wind (available at Lloyds Pharmacy) cold presses the whole plant, retaining all the original compounds. Hemp-derived CBD oil is non-intoxicating.
