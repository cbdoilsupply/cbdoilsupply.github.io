<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Another huge benefit that comes with using CBD as a pain reliever is that it has no meaningful interactions with opioids, meaning it won't impact the effects of regular painkillers and can be taken alongside them.

<p>This raw extract can be put through a series of filtration and distillation processes to remove unwanted compounds, such as waxes and chlorophyll, and produce various classes of oils differing in purity and CBD content. Fab CBD offers a limited range of products, but what it lacks in variety it definitely makes up in quality. In one study on morphine-addicted rats, CBD oil allowed them to reduce their dependence on the drug. CBD oil isn't likely to cause the same set of negative effects.
