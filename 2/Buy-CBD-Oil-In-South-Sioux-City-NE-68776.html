<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Both hemp and marijuana come from the same plant (Cannabis sativa), which creates a fair amount of confusion. Not all products, however, include that information. While CBD is often used to increase appetites, decrease nausea and decrease pain experienced by cancer patients, the true benefits of the compound may be further reaching. CBD oil can also be used in many different ways and has a variety of applications for natural health. While CBD makers often claim the chemical can help with anxiety, improve sleep and reduce pain, the only legally edible version of CBD is a drug, Epidiolex, prescribed to treat seizure disorders.</p>

It can also alleviate the nausea, pain, and gastric inflammation , as well as reduce gastrointestinal motility , or stop the food from moving too quickly through the system.

<p>Hemp oil with CBD has become the product of choice for many to give to their pets because it is non-psychoactive, non-toxic, and highly tolerable in animals. Different cannabis plants — often called hemp or marijuana — contain different levels of chemical compounds.

<h3>Where Can I Buy CBD Oil in South Sioux City NE?</h3>
<p>Interestingly, research has shown that CBD acts to reduce the psychoactive effects of THC, separating hemp further from marijuana.

As the largest CBD manufacturer to partner with 1% for the Planet, we'll be donating 1% of Sunsoil's annual sales to help environmental non-profits that do good for people, plants and our planet.</p>

What may shock you is that some of the CBD products that we came across were known to contain chemicals that were harmful to your health. In states where cannabis is illegal, CBD oil must be made from hemp. Alongside traditional CBD oil, we also offer a wide selection of alternative carrier oils.</p>
<p>In addition to these incredible health benefits, emerging evidence suggests that CBD provides even more benefits when combined with natural terpenoids and other phytocannabinoids found in the hemp plant. However, the overall risks associated with CBD are considered to be mild, and most users do not experience any significant adverse effects. Additionally, studies have found that CBD and other cannabinoids are helpful in managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting , and may also help to improve appetite.</p>
