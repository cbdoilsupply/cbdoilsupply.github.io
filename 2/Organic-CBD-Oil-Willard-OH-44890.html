<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. When the Control Substance Act was passed in 1970, cultivation of both hemp and marijuana was banned, making it even hard to research or use CBD extract. Luckily, if the level of CBD is high enough, the psychoactive side effects of THC are counteracted. However, scientists believe CBD encourages the body to produce more endocannabinoids. The hemp the brand uses was specifically bred to have high CBD and really low THC. All of our CBD products are guaranteed to contain 0% THC, and each and every product that leaves the facility is third-party tested to ensure consistency and quality.</p>
<p>Canopy Growth Corporation is one of the leading medical marijuana companies that manufactures and sells CBD oil products through its well-known subsidiary Bedrocan. The term Marijuana is mostly used these days in place of Cannabis (and not hemp) as it is associated these days with recreational Cannabis (Cannabis high in THC). CBD is a cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. Products that contain CBD isolate should only contain CBD.

<p>I highly recommend American Shaman CBD & Terpene Hemp Oil Tincture. Since the market offers lots of different CBD products, you can choose one or several ways of how to use cannabidiol. There is evidence of ill-effects of marijuana products on babies, if the mother is using it during her pregnancy or while she is still breastfeeding her child ( 20 , 21 & 22 ). However, there is no such evidence regarding CBD in its pure form, which has only 0.3% THC at the most. CBD oil or Cannabidiol is a natural molecule of cannabis, which comes from the hemp plant.</p>
