<p>The best CBD oils on the market are those that will help you manage your health, change the way that you address your health problems, and will make you feel like a functional human being during the day. In locations where recreational marijuana is legal, consumers can enjoy CBD oil and products that contain some percentage of THC if they want a mild high without some of the negative effects of THC. A study using Sativex, an oral spray that combines CBD and THC, has proven very effective, reducing spasms in 75% of the 276 people with MS who were resistant to regular medication. Even the staff at Merry Jane have taken note of Penguin CBD, with a positive first-hand review of their products. This is also because of the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD that will soothe the skin and reduce the pain of some skin conditions as well.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that people have been using cannabis medicinally since at least 2900 B.C. However, we are just now beginning to understand cannabis' effects on the body - and even today, there are still large gaps in our knowledge of this fascinating plant. The capability of CBD oil to reduce inflammation is beneficial for the management of many different conditions. Marijuana grown for recreational purposes typically contains much higher levels of THC than CBD. However, the best places to buy CBD oil — even shops to buy CBD oil online —should have the contents of their products clearly listed.</p>

For instance, a study published in Neurotherapeutics in 2015 noticed that CBD has significant potential as a treatment option for muscle spasticity, tension, rigidity and other conditions that result from poor workouts, overwork or chronic stress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, illegal and unregulated products can contain harmful contaminants such as heavy metals, bacteria, fungus, viruses, herbicides, or pesticides. One thing to keep in mind when buying hemp extracts and hoping for the best on Amazon is that you don't want to purchase hemp seed oil.” Hemp seed oil contains a litany of healthy fatty acids, proteins and micronutrients However, it doesn't contain CBD.
