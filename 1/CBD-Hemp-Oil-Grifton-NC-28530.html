<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. More research is needed to determine the exact role that terpenes play in the overall effects of CBD oil, but it seems clear that terpenes work in concert with cannabinoids to produce a richer effect than CBD alone. First, testing by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has found evidence of ‘potential adverse health effects' from CBD (more on that later) and the FSA has concerns over CBD products being sold that contain unlisted and possibly even hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of psychoactive THC.</p>

<p>Even the symptoms of highly aggressive and potentially rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disorders such as Prion diseases (the most well known of which are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, commonly referred to as Mad Cow disease) may be countered by CBD's neuroprotective qualities; however, there have been no studies conducted on CBD oil benefits for these specific disorders. Each Veré CBD product is bred from top-grade medical hemp strains. The risks of using cannabis products containing THC (the chemical that gets you high) are not currently clear.</p>
<p>Much of this research is still in the early phases (with a lot of room to learn more), however, CBD may be worth adding to a daily routine for those frustrated with traditional treatment options. In the meantime, much research is underway, and many studies about CBD's effects on the human body have already been published.

<p>Creating these CBD products from start to finish is a task that requires creators and distributors to invest a substantial amount of money. Although price may be an indicator of CBD oil quality, we suggest researching the following factors to ensure the oil you select is considered high-quality. The more we learn about cannabinoids, the more we understand their effects on the human body and the huge potential they can offer. The updated 2018 Farm Bill will clear away hemp coming from the DEA's list of illegal drugs whichare going to additionally increase the exposure of potential clinical CBD benefits.</p>
<p>In 2015 and in 2016, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) ran some tests on CBD products sold through websites. Researchers at the Department of Pharmacognosy, The School of Pharmacy, University of London, UK, basis the study conducted on mice found that CBD oil has analgesic properties and may relieve chronic pain of all kinds It can disrupt the activity of pain receptors in the body and instead cause a release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine - feel good” compounds that can ease discomfort and pain, even if the pharmaceutical painkillers have no effect.</p>
<p>As a result, the quality, amount of CBD per dose, and safety of the products can vary dramatically, and it is difficult to calculate an optimal dosage. The hemp seed oil also provides a healthy dose of Omega acids and essential fatty acids. Now that the plant is legally distinct from its cousin of the same name (Cannabis sativa), you can find hemp products just about everywhere, from the crunchiest of health food co-ops to big-box retailers in the ‘burbs. A review in Neurotherapeutics concluded that CBD may be an effective treatment for those with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
