Every CBD product is lab tested for quality and potency, and there is a QR code on each product to see third-party test results and confirm that the CBD product you select meets regulatory requirements.

<p>Technically speaking, the law now recognizes hemp (and by association CBD oil) as a non-controlled substance and differentiates it from marijuana. One of the most crucial steps in producing CBD oil is isolating the relevant cannabinoids and terpenes via COâ‚‚ extraction. This being the case, there are a lot of companies taking advantage of the CBD oil demand thus are making products that don't contain enough or any CBD at all. Meanwhile, hemp seed oil (sometimes called just hemp oil) is made from only the seeds of the hemp plant and contains minuscule (if any) quantities of CBD.</p>
