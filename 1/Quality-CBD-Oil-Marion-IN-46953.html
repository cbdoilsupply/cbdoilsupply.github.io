<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. When you use a phytocannabinoid, you supplement the bodies natural endocannabinoids to increase the ability (the gain) of the endocannabinoid system to orchestrate (think orchestra conductor) the various receptors and systems needed to bring the body back into a healthy working balance.

As we mentioned earlier, some CBD oil products are actually oil infused with pure CBD. Many hemp oil extracts are also known to lack the full spectrum of terpenes and other cannabinoids that act synergistically with the CBD. Such products lack the synergistic array of beneficial components found in full-spectrum CBD-rich oil. That being said, it's worth mentioning right out of the gate that the terms hemp oil and CBD oil do not refer to the same thing, although the two are often used interchangeably.</p>

The best hemp CBD oil comes from plants grown in the most ideal conditions.

You might hear it referred to as cannabis oil, but apart from coming from the cannabis plant, this isn't generally an appropriate term. For therapeutic uses, many people prefer hemp-derived CBD products, as they do not cause intoxication.</p>
