<p>The best CBD oils on the market are those that will help you manage your health, change the way that you address your health problems, and will make you feel like a functional human being during the day. However, taking more CBD than needed might cause some unwanted effects such as making you too relaxed for particular activities like work or sports. A prescription for medical cannabis would only be given when it was believed to be in your best interests, and when other treatments had not worked or were not suitable.
