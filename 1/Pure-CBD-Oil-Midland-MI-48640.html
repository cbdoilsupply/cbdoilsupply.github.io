<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. In short, to determine whether a CBD oil or any other CBD product is legal or illegal depends on a multitude of factors. In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
<p>A small 2010 study found that cannabidiol could reduce symptoms of social anxiety in people with social anxiety disorder (SAD). CBD oil is non-psychoactive and non-intoxicating, which means it can be safely consumed by people of all ages. CBD's anti-anxiety effect is why many in the cannabis community talk about how CBD relieves paranoia, although that is not scientifically proven yet. One of the most celebrated health benefits of CBD oil is its analgesic (pain relieving) effects. Of course, price will always be a determining factor in the CBD products you choose to use.</p>
