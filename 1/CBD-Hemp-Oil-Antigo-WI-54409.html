<h3>Buy Hemp CBD Oil in Antigo WI</h3>
<p>Not to be confused with hemp seed oil , CBD oil comes from industrial hemp plants that have been bred to contain trace amounts of THC - the ingredient in the marijuana plant that's associated with a so-called ‘high'. Because CBD works with specific neurotransmitters to reduce anxiety and increase the ability to focus, initial studies have shown promise in its ability to increase the quality of life by decreasing the symptoms of ADHD for many sufferers. Conversely, the hemp plant will have a higher concentration of CBD than THC.</p>
<p>It is legal to buy and take CBD supplements in the UK. In order to be legal, CBD supplements need to contain 1mg or less per pack of THC - the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that causes a 'high'. Tikun Hemp was started by the famous Tikun Olam, the world's first organization licensed to produce and distribute medical cannabis.

Every CBD product is lab tested for quality and potency, and there is a QR code on each product to see third-party test results and confirm that the CBD product you select meets regulatory requirements. Keep in mind that nonprescription CBD products are not FDA-approved, and may be inaccurately labeled. Those cannabinoids could include not just CBD and THC but dozens of other related compounds.</p>
<p>If the product is full-spectrum, it will have less than 0.3% THC, the federally legal limit for industrial hemp plants. Hemp-derived CBD oils are great because they can provide the healing potential of cannabis without the high. This is not to be confused with hemp oil used in food and beauty, which is made from the seeds of the same plant. Importing any cannabis or hemp product into the United States is a complicated and serious task, so we leave nothing to chance before our high-CBD hemp oil makes its journey across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
