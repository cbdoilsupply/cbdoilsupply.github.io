<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. CBD Hemp Oil - Often referred to as full-spectrum CBD oil” or full-spectrum hemp extract,” these oils are produced by extracting phytochemicals and phytocannabinoids from industrial hemp - a variety of cannabis that contains less than 0.3% THC by weight. However, cannabinol (CBN) did trigger a positive test, and of course, products with some THC triggered a positive test as well. If you were to type in the following phrases, you will get a list of products that actually might carry some cannabinoids in them.</p>
