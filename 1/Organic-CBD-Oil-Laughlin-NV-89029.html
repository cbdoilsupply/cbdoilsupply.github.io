In recent years, medical researchers have become increasingly interested in CBD as a treatment for seizures and epilepsy, particularly for children. As for anti-aging beauty products (yes, there are anti-aging CBD products) such as serums, creams, cleansers-you name it-the jury's out. Because the compound is associated with a variety of health benefits but lacks mind-altering effects, it is being marketed as treatment for insomnia and other sleep disorders, in addition to issues like anxiety, epilepsy, and pain.</p>
