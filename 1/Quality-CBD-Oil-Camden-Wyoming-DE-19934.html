<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. Hemp oil extract in the United States refers to the oil extracted from the stalk of the hemp plant. In the United States, CBD oil is legal in some states, but not all. Remember, the best CBD products contain less than 0.3% THC and come from 100% organic, non-GMO, and pesticide-free industrial hemp. They are best suited for the production of industrial hemp, seeds, and CBD. Bottom line: CBD oil has been found through several studies to help reduce depression and anxiety disorders in both animals and humans. Different volumes of CBD oils can sometimes cause confusion among inexperienced users.</p>

<p>Cannabidiol Reduces Spasticity, Pain, Inflammation, Fatigue, and Depression in PwMS.
