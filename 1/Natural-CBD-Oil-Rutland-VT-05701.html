<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures.

<p>Transdermal application, or rubbing a hemp body butter directly onto your skin is an alternative to oral consumption capable of targeting specific pain points. Look for products made from organic, U.S.-grown cannabis. CBD oil is extracted from the Cannabis sativa plant and then mixed with a carrier oil so that your body can more easily absorb it.
