<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. One important way in which CBD oil may help athletes is by reducing pain and minimizing inflammation post-workout. With a range spanning from CBD oils to CBD chocolates, all manufactured in the UK to strict specifications, customers can trust in Hempura for their CBD requirements. CBD oil derived from marijuana (Cannabis sativa plants containing more than 0.3% THC), on the other hand, is federally illegal. Pure hemp oil does not contain any cannabinoids, and therefore will not provide the same effect as CBD oil.</p>
<p>If you do have a serious medical condition, we recommend speaking to your doctor to see if these products are right for you. These include the source and variety of hemp, the method of extraction used to produce the raw hemp extract, whether or not the company uses nanoemulsion technology, and the quality of the other ingredients in the products they offer.
