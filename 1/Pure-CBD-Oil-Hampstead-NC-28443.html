<p>In regards to eye health, cannabis oil has been linked to the reduction in glaucoma and the prevention of macular degeneration. Our hemp is grown in organic soil, free of any hazardous chemicals to maintain quality. CBD oil promotes a positive outlook: A study published in 2015 showed that CBD use in persons diagnosed with a bipolar condition helped improve not only their mood but also led them to have a more optimistic outlook on life. Topical products, like lotions and balms, are applied to the skin over a painful joint.</p>

As with anything else we take into our bodies, you will want to be sure that the CBD oil products you choose are pure. But what these people probably don't realize is — you aren't talking about the vilified drug compound (THC) found in the marijuana plant - but you are referring to the oil expressed from the hemp plant.</p>
<p>In fact, in order to compete with the market and not lose out to vastly inferior-quality brands, the price of some CW Hemp products have been reduced by up to 40%. There is growing evidence that the non-psychoactive compounds in marijuana, such as CBD, could provide a new treatment for chronic pain.

<p>For mild discomfort and health problems, there's the 125mg CBD oil which offers about 2.08mg of CBD per serving. However, in the hemp plant, which is a different strain of the species Cannabis sativa, CBD is the main active ingredient, and THC is barely present, making its use and legality more widespread. These seeds are high in protein, healthy fats, and other minerals but low in THC or the psychoactive compound you can find in marijuana. If a vendor is marketing something as hemp oil, make sure that you dientify whether it's hemp seed oil or in fact CBD hemp oil made from aerial parts of the plant.</p>
