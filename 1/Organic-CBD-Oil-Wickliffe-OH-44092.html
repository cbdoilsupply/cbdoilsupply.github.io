<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC â€” one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds.

CBD oil is a perishable product, so we recommend storing the bottle in a dry, cool, and dark location for best results.</p>
<h2>Cannabis Oil a Cancer Treatment Alternative to Chemotherapy in Wickliffe?</h2>

However, studies have concluded that some side effects might be attributed to its interaction with other drugs you might be taking. Studies of CBD oil aren't common. The term "cannabis oil" is sometimes used to describe CBD oil; however, it's more commonly used to describe oil produced from marijuana strains containing significant THC levels. But CBD in its isolate and low-THC forms is not likely to cause anxiety.</p>
