<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket. Each of these uses our high quality hemp extract, with 0% THC. Some manufacturers are advertising CBD products with unproven medical claims, and the quality and safety of these products can vary.</p>
<p>These products use extracts from hemp and cannabis plants grown in carefully controlled environments to boost CBD concentrations. CBD, short for cannabidiol, is an active compound found in the cannabis plant.
