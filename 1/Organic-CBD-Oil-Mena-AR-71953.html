<p>If a CBD oil has more than 0.3% THC, then it's no longer considered as hemp. When cannabidiol oil is drawn from the Cannabis Sativa plant and bottled for consumption, some brands extract the CBD seed oil and combine it within another type of carrier oil for consumption. This was a major leap for epilepsy treatment, but the negative stigma around CBD and cannabis at the time made it hard for the team to publicize their discovery. Many more studies, especially on large numbers of human participants, are still needed to fully understand the effects of CBD oil and other cannabis-based treatments on RA symptoms.</p>

They use full-spectrum CBD oil carried in MCT oil, which is the industry standard for quality. Prior to 2015, the CBD oil market was relatively small, with the total market sales thought to be valued at around $202 million Of this, approximately $90 million came from hemp-derived CBD oil products, while the rest (around $112 million) came from the sale of marijuana-derived CBD oil.
