<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil.

<p>Authentic CBD products, with no THC whatsoever, undergo a number of complicated and expensive processes. However, others are of the opinion that CBD may, in fact, promote healthy fetal brain development, since CBD can promote neurogenesis.

<p>Marijuana-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess, and consume for adults 21 and over and approved minors. CBD derived from marijuana and hemp is touted as having many health-promoting benefits. Since CBD provides robust pain relief options, it is possible to use it as a treatment strategy.

<p>It's important to know that although THC and CBD are the most studied components of cannabis, there are many more chemical compounds found within the plant, such as the phytocannabinoids cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), as well as terpenes and flavonoids. CBD oil is an isolated extraction of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol. THC is the psychoactive component of cannabis that causes a euphoric high, but CBD oils contain very low concentrations of THC.</p>
