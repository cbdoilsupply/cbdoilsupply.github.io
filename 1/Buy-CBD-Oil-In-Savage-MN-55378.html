<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. This creates a positive effect on the body's pain and inflammation responses. One study split 177 patients with cancer-related pain into three groups: placebo, THC treatment, and THC + CBD treatment. Because it produces no euphoria or psychoactive effects at all, CBD oil is not addictive. All CBD products sold at Indiana locations of Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, a Midwest regional chain, now carry those codes, says Jonathan Lawrence, director of vitamins and body care at the chain. Another recent study , which examined the effect of CBD on an animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), found that the treatment led to an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which, in turn, helped suppress the EAE.</p>
<p>Canopy Growth Corporation is one of the leading medical marijuana companies that manufactures and sells CBD oil products through its well-known subsidiary Bedrocan.

CBD is a cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. Products that contain CBD isolate should only contain CBD. As you know CBD is a new treatment option so there are almost no scientific studies and very few case studies available.</p>
