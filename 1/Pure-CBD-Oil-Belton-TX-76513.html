<p>In a similar way, some of the other side effects such as mood changes and dizziness definitely should be watched with a careful eye - after all, studies are still young and we can't be 100% sure how CBD affects everyone, just how it affects most normal people. The company will be rolling out CBD products to its nearly ten thousand shops throughout 2020 and its online store.
