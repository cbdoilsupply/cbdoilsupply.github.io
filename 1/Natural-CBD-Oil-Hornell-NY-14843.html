<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN). In a 2016 study , Scott Shannon and his fellow researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins demonstrated that CBD oil can be safely and effectively used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders in children with PTSD.</p>
<p>Plant Hemp Oil Extract CBD Dosage Guide for People and Pets Our mission is to formulate, distribute and provide education about our premium CBD.

In order to save itself from breaking any federal (or global) laws, Amazon has added cannabis-derived products to its list of banned items.

<p>Brands can only sell their products as a food supplement, and must not make medical claims. However, many consumers may be unaware of the actual cannabinoid content of their CBD oil. The updated 2018 Farm Bill will remove hemp from the DEA's list of controlled substances which will also increase the exposure of potential medical CBD benefits.
