<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Premium Jane focuses on bringing you pure and simple CBD products made from hemp grown in highly controlled, strain-specific microclimates. No prescription or doctor is needed for the purchase of CBD oil since these products do not contain THC like cannabis does.

Founded in 2018, Mission Farms CBD has established itself as a provider of quality CBD products. CBD is in early clinical trials for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, says Blessing, who is currently studying whether CBD could be used to treat PTSD in people with alcohol use disorder.</p>
