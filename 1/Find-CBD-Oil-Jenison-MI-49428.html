Scientists refer to a phenomenon called the entourage effect.” This principle suggests that cannabinoids like CBD work best in combination with other cannabinoids (like THC, CBN, and CBG). The compound is also nonpsychoactive (meaning it does not produce the ‘high' associated with cannabis use), making it a safe and effective option for patients who may be concerned about the mind altering effects of other cannabinoids such as THC.</p>
<p>While marijuana has been used to treat pain for centuries, CBD introduces a new way to achieve the same result.

You would probably be hard-pressed to find any quality CBD products in a convenience store. I have read about studies from Europe (not very specific I know) that suggest CBD might work better for some people if combined with some level of THC.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol has been shortened to CBD simply because it's customary for cannabinoids to have a three-letter designation, such as THC for tetrahydrocannabinol, CBG for cannabigerol, CBN for cannabinol and so forth. Research shows that dogs using CBD oil for osteoarthritis were more active and had less pain. Not all CBD products are created equal and not all CBD stores are trustworthy.
