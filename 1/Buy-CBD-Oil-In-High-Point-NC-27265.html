<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. Again, the answer in most cases is no. This is because most CBD products today are made from hemp, which contains less than 0.3% THC content on a dry weight basis. Prof 'Sullivan points out that novelty products like CBD cappuccinos and ice-cream, often sold at a premium, have so little CBD in them that "there's just no possibility it's going to have a biological effect". Learn all that you can about CBD oil, its uses, effects, side-effects, types, etc. CBD Oil, CBD Hemp Oil, Hemp CBD Oil, and Hemp Oil are some of the common phrases you will encounter when you buy CBD oil.</p>

CBD oil is non-psychoactive and non-intoxicating, which means it can be safely consumed by people of all ages. CBD's anti-anxiety effect is why many in the cannabis community talk about how CBD relieves paranoia, although that is not scientifically proven yet. One of the most celebrated health benefits of CBD oil is its analgesic (pain relieving) effects. Of course, price will always be a determining factor in the CBD products you choose to use.</p>

The CBD in most products is extracted from hemp, a variety of cannabis that has only traces (up to 0.3%) of THC, the active compound that gets people high. Many CBD products display the percentage of CBD contained in the product, which will be between around 2% and 11% of the total (the rest being made up of hemp oil and other ingredients such as olive oil). Alongside this, CBD - in combination with THC - has received regulatory approvals in several European countries and is under study in registered trials with the FDA.</p>
