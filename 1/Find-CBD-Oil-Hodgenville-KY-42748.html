<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Another huge benefit that comes with using CBD as a pain reliever is that it has no meaningful interactions with opioids, meaning it won't impact the effects of regular painkillers and can be taken alongside them. As with other wellness products, there is no one-size-fits-all serving amount for CBD. CBD is one of 104 chemical compounds, known as cannabinoids, that can be found in the cannabis plant.

<p>Hemp-derived CBD is legal federally. Even though recreational pot is far from legal on a national scale, the use of medical marijuana is currently permitted in 30 of America's 50 states This might be why the majority of our respondents had already heard whispers about marijuana's non-psychoactive derivative, CBD-a substance oft-used as an alternative treatment for common ailments including pain, depression, and anxiety. Also, depending on the amount used and route of administration, these products have the potential to produce impairing drug effects.</p>

Michigan: If passed, the Michigan Marijuana Legislation Initiative would legalize recreational and medical marijuana use for all adults over the age of 21. This measure was approved.
