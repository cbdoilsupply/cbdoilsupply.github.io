<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. In a short-term study , 42 patients taking CBD oil reported reduced cravings for up to one week after their dose of CBD. The hemp leaves the soil in better condition than before it was planted and it's a renewable resource because every part of the plant is usable. In turn, CBD oil may offer benefits for acne management. Its products include Bedrocan, a sativa plant type cannabis; Bedropuur, a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) indica for THC extraction, Bedica, an indica dominant strain of cannabis; Bedrobinol, Bediol, and Bedrolite products, the sativa dominant strains of cannabis.</p>
<p>Although there is not much hereditary difference between cannabis and hemp, the plants' flowers and leaves contain different amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid responsible for getting high.” Though research has shown some traces of THC in certain CBD oils, most do not contain any THC. But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>

Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine. While there's a lot of tongue-wagging around cannabis-related products, there is a burgeoning awareness about the potential medical benefits of CBD oil.</p>
