<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits. Additionally, several animal studies have demonstrated that CBD may help reduce the inflammation and cell death associated with heart disease due to its powerful antioxidant and stress-reducing properties. For a CBD product to be considered as a legal hemp product, it needs to have no more than 0.3% THC.</p>

Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a chemical compound naturally found in the genus of plants known as cannabis. CBD oil has been safely used to treat anxiety, including sleeplessness and PTSD. Unlike most meds meant for PD management, however, CBD oil doesn't come with serious side effects like ankle swelling, insomnia, liver damage, urinary problems, constipation, diarrhea, skin blotching, and nausea. CBD oil is a perishable product, so we recommend storing the bottle in a dry, cool, and dark location for best results.</p>

Terpenoids are the natural oils produced by hemp and they're responsible for the plant's distinct aroma. Solvents that are commonly used to extract CBD from cannabis include supercritical CO2, ethanol, hydrocarbons (such as butane) and olive oil.

It's just a matter of time before CBD products are regulated by the FDA.
