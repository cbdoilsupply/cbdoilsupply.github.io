Hemp Bombs is another company that oversees the whole process of their CBD products, from seed to sale. There are still no regulations for how often CBD products must be tested. CBD oil is made by extracting CBD from the cannabis or hemp plants and then mixing it with a carrier such as MCT oil.

The chemical that is responsible for weed's psychoactive effects is called THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol , and it is mostly removed from CBD products. And we're continuing to hear more about cannabis-sourced products.</p>

A study from 2005 compared olive oil and hemp oil in people experiencing eczema.</p>
<p>It's important to know that although THC and CBD are the most studied components of cannabis, there are many more chemical compounds found within the plant, such as the phytocannabinoids cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), as well as terpenes and flavonoids. CBD oil is an isolated extraction of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol. THC is the psychoactive component of cannabis that causes a euphoric high, but CBD oils contain very low concentrations of THC.</p>
