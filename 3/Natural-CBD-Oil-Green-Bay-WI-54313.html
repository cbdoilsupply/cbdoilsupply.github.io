<p>The amount of CBD present in the trichomes will depend on the particular variety of cannabis or hemp. A bioavailability of 100% would signify that 100% of the CBD in the product is available to your body. This could mean that people taking anti-epilepsy drugs alongside CBD will need to adjust their dosage downward to avoid side effects, Welty noted.

<p>Knowing the source of your CBD oil will help you know its quality. Humans have the endocannabinoid system, or ECS, meaning they naturally respond to the influx of cannabinoids from the cannabis plant. For hemp-derived CBD oil, the product's COA would include information on which cannabinoids, along with compounds like heavy metals, are in the product. It's one of the many active cannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa plant. However, within the past decade, they have become increasingly interested in the therapeutic benefits of the other compounds found in both varieties, especially cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
<p>Companies that market CBD oil make a wide variety of claims about it. However, scientists and doctors emphasize that the research on CBD is limited, and has been slowed in the United States by federal restrictions. The studies provide proof of principle” that CBD and possibly CBD-THC combinations are valid candidates for novel AD therapies. Less potent than cannabis (from which it's derived), but more potent than hemp (also derived from weed), the specific benefits of CBD are much less well-known than the ingredients itself.</p>
<p>If the product is full-spectrum, it will have less than 0.3% THC, the federally legal limit for industrial hemp plants. Hemp-derived CBD oils are great because they can provide the healing potential of cannabis without the high. This is not to be confused with hemp oil used in food and beauty, which is made from the seeds of the same plant. Importing any cannabis or hemp product into the United States is a complicated and serious task, so we leave nothing to chance before our high-CBD hemp oil makes its journey across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
