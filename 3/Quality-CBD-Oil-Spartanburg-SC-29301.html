<p>88 89 Eases Anxiety.Unlike THC, which can actually trigger anxiety and paranoia in some people, CBD is well known for its ability to reduce anxiety. It is a warehouse of fake products sold by individuals who understand that CBD is a highly searched keyword. One report found that short-term use of CBD oil could reduce the levels of spasticity a person feels. In a high profile case in 2018, Hannah Deacon, whose son Alfie, has severe epilepsy, was allowed to bring medicinal cannabis oil into the UK for the first time, following a painful legal battle.</p>
