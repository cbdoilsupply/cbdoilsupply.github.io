<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Despite the above listed potential side effects, a review of clinical data found that the side effects of CBD used for certain applications were less severe than side effects from common medications used to treat those same health conditions. CBD can come from the marijuana plant but it is most commonly harvested from the hemp plant to eliminate the THC. Keep up with new strains, products, trends, and deals with Leafly's curated cannabis newsletter. As another precaution for people who experience drowsiness as a result of consuming CBD oil, reducing the dosage can be a good option.</p>
