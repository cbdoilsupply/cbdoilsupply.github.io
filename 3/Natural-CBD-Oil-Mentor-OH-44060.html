<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. In short, to determine whether a CBD oil or any other CBD product is legal or illegal depends on a multitude of factors. In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Simple online search data shows that CBD oil and anxiety is one of the most frequently-searched topics (at least in terms of cannabis-related therapy and medical treatment). CBD, or cannabidiol, is simply one of over 80+ cannabinoids that can be extracted from hemp. Formerly known as CannaVest, CV Sciences reported impressive growth and profitability this year that has demonstrated the power of its products and brand recognition with the CBD oil industry.

That document shows how a product performed on tests checking for CBD and THC levels, and the presence of contaminants.</p>
<p>Of course, more than half of U.S. states permit the use of medical (non-recreational) cannabis, which includes cannabis-derived CBD oil for specific treatments. Full-spectrum CBD oil contains less than 0.3% THC. Store CBD oils and tinctures in a dry, cool place away from direct heat and sunlight.
