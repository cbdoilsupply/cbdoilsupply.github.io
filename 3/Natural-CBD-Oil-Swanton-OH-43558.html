<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. Find out for yourself why our oils have received thousands of positive reviews and have led the industry for years. And as far as how to use CBD oil for pain, anxiety, depression, or any other issue—having it with a meal or some kind of drink is all you need really.

Edible forms of CBD should be able to provide general anti-inflammatory benefits to arthritis sufferers, while topical solutions containing CBD oil can be soothing and healing for localized joint pains.

<p>The answer is simple - purchase CBD products from a company with over three decades of experience in cannabis and cannabinoids.

<p>CBD and THC are both anti-analgesics (pain relief). If true, the news that a cannabis product killed someone would amount to the upending of a longstanding claim from weed legalization advocates that the drug is so safe no one has ever died from it. And this wasn't a case of high-THC cannabis allegedly causing psychosis—it was a possible reaction to CBD oil, an increasingly popular and widely available wellness product in the United States. Cannabidiol , a non-euphoriant phytocannabinoid common in certain strains, shares neuroprotective effects with THC, inhibits glutamate neurotoxicity, and displays antioxidant activity greater than ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or tocopherol (vitamin E).</p>
<p>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a type of cannabinoid, a chemical found naturally in cannabis ( marijuana and hemp ) plants.

Summary CBD, especially in combination with THC, may be effective in reducing pain associated with diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Another factor to be considered is whether or not the product being used contains a full spectrum or broad spectrum CBD oil with terpenes.</p>
