<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. There are a number of products made with CBD isolate that are available on the market, which provide the benefits of CBD any detectable amounts of THC, and they are popular products of choice for parents of small children, competitive athletes, or anyone looking to avoid even trace amounts of THC. One of the two products The Post tested that didn't include CBD was a tincture from Tranquilo Essentials, a company whose Twitter handle was @AmazonBestCBD.
