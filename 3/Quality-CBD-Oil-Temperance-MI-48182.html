However, for people in special circumstances, such as athletes operating under WADA guidelines or those in professions where workplace drug testing takes place, it is advisable to check with the relevant testing facility whether the consumption of CBD capsules or droppers would put you at risk of a false positive. As voters in more and more states choose to legalize marijuana for medicinal and increasingly for recreational use, related products like CBD oil are trending.</p>
