<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. Our ultimate goal is to create CBD wellness products that we would not only take ourselves but also be proud to share with our friends and family. But there are still products labeled as dietary supplements on the market that contain cannabidiol. CV Sciences products are sold in more than 1,500 health food stores nationally, including Campbell's Nutrition in Des Moines and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in West Des Moines. CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a natural active compound found in Cannabis plants.

For the highest concentration of CBD, products like our flagship brand Real Scientific Hemp Oil (RSHO) pure CBD hemp oil gives you up to 190 mg of CBD per serving.</p>

<p>Many people who live with anxiety and depression have become interested in cannabis oil's natural approach as it has shown to treat these disorders without the side effects experienced when using other conventional drugs.

For those who wish the acknowledged health benefits of cannabinoid without unsettling side effects, CBD may be the perfect choice.

Cannabinoids such as CBD have a dizzying array of functions in the human body, influencing everything from inflammation to anxiety and depression.

Full spectrum products, in addition to their CBD content, contain a wide range of supportive phytochemicals, including beneficial compounds like terpenes, flavonoids, omega acids, and phytocannabinoids. Our registered industrial hemp-derived Pure CBD Oil tests at a minimum of 99%+ CBD purity and is third-party lab tested and verified 100% THC-free.

<p>Hussain SA, Dlugos DJ, Cilio MR, Parikh N, Oh A, Sankar R. Synthetic pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol for treatment of refractory infantile spasms: A multicenter phase-2 study. Our legal CBD products are now available in 50mg, 100mg, 250mg, 550mg, 1000mg, and 1500mg tinctures.
